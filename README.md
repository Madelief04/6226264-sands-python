# 17/09/2025: i added a sin signal to my actualprojectfile.py to start and look if it works. it does. i can see it in my reposetory now. 
# i changed the code into an actual sinusoidal signal in my actualprjectfile.py.
Now a define function is used for the sine wave. Also the file name is changed from actualprojectfile.py to signals.py.
