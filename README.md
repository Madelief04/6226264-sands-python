17/09/2025: i added a sin signal to my actualprojectfile.py to start and look if it works. it does. i can see it in my reposetory now. 
i changed the code into an actual sinusoidal signal in my actualprjectfile.py.



Now a define function is used for the sine wave. Also the file name is changed from actualprojectfile.py to signals.py.
A sawtooth function is added, using the same parameters plus the width. 
        width=0 gives a rising sawtooth, width=1 is a falling sawtooth signal. 
For both signals the parameters frequency, amplitude, duration and sampling_rate can be changed.
